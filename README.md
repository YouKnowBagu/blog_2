# New version of Blog
## The project
Build a multi user blog.  The purpose of this is to create an upgraded version of my first blog while also learning several new technologies; specifically, grid instead of flexbox, Django instead of Flask, and an anaconda virtual environment instead of the nightmare of a local dev environment I created last time.  I am building this on a Macbook Air running Linux Mint 18.1, mainly using Visual Studio Code as my text editor and a fish shell instead of bash.

Shotout to the blog [fullstackpython.com] for being a great resource for all things Python.  After initial set up the blog will be found at seanpsampson.com where I will post updates as I go.
